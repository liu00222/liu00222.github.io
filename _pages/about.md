I will join [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) at Boston in June 2022 as a Software Engineer. 

Currently, I am a Master of Science student at Duke University majoring in Computer Science. My advisor is [Professor Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) and I am working in [Neil Gong's Research Group](http://gonglab.pratt.duke.edu/) on projects related to Trustworthy AI. I also work at [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) supervised by [Professor Miroslav Pajic](https://people.duke.edu/~mp275/) in the topic of the security issues in Autonomous Vehicles, especially the perception algorithms. 

In 2020, I received my B.S. in Statistical Science and B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and graduated with high distinction. During this period, I worked in the [Digital Arts, Science & Humanities Program](https://www.lib.umn.edu/collections/search-up-books) supervised by Dr. Benjamin Wiggins. 

My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI. More specifically, I am interested in analyzing the security & privcacy issues of modern machine learning models, e.g., deep neural networks and transformers. I am also interested in working to build both empirical and certified defense methods to make the AI more trustworthy.
