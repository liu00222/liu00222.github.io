I am an EDG Engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) in Boston, MA starting from June 2022. 

I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science from Duke University. My advisor is [Professor Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) and I worked in Neil Gong's Research Group on projects related to the topics of the intersection between Security & Privacy and Machine Learning. During my master's study, I also worked at Cyber-Physical Systems Lab advised by [Professor Miroslav Pajic](https://people.duke.edu/~mp275/) in the topic of security issues in Autonomous Vehicles and perception algorithms. Besides, I was the recipient of the Dean's Research Award for Master's students 2021-22. 

Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Statistical Science and B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and graduated with high distinction. I worked closely with Dr. Benjamin Wiggins and Cody Hennesy in several projects related to digital arts and humanities, and one of the representatives is [Search University Press Books](https://www.lib.umn.edu/collections/search-up-books). In 2020, I received the Buehler Memorial Undergraduate Award from the School of Statistics. 

My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI.
