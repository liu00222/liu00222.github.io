I will join [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) at Boston in June 2022 as a Software Engineer. 

Currently, I am a Master of Science student at Duke University majoring in Computer Science. My advisor is [Professor Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) and I am working in [Neil Gong's Research Group](http://gonglab.pratt.duke.edu/) on projects related to the topics of the intersection between Security & Privacy and Machine Learning. During my master's study, I also work at [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) advised by [Professor Miroslav Pajic](https://people.duke.edu/~mp275/) in the topic of the security issues in Autonomous Vehicles and perception algorithms. 

Before this, I received my B.S. in Statistical Science and B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and graduated with high distinction. I worked closely with Dr. Benjamin Wiggins and Cody Hennesy in the project of [Search University Press Books](https://www.lib.umn.edu/collections/search-up-books). 

My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI.
