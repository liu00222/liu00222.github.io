I expect to start my Software Engineer position at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) in Boston, MA in June, 2022. 

Currently, I am a Master of Science student at Duke University majoring in Computer Science, advised by [Professor Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/), working on projects related to Trustworthy AI. I also work at [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) with Professor Miroslav Pajic in the topic of the security in Autonomous Vehicles. 

Before, I received my B.S. in Statistical Science and B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI.
