I am currently a Software Engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/). 

I received the M.S. in Computer Science from Duke University in 2022. My advisor is [Dr. Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) and I have worked closely with [Dr. Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/) on research projects related to trustworthy machine learning, including security & privacy of AI, LLM security, and foundation model security. I also worked in Cyber-Physical Systems Lab supervised by [Dr. Miroslav Pajic](https://people.duke.edu/~mp275/) in projects involving autonomous vehicles safety. In 2021, I received the Dean's Research Award for Master's students. 

In 2020, I received the B.S. in Stats and B.A. in CS from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities with high distinction. I was also the recipient of the Buehler Memorial Undergraduate Award from the School of Statistics. 

My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI.
