I am an Engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) Engineering Development Group in Boston, MA. 

I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science from Duke University in 2022. My advisor is [Professor Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) and I worked closely with [Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/) in Neil Gong's Research Group on projects of machine learning in the adversarial setting. I also worked in Cyber-Physical Systems Lab supervised by [Professor Miroslav Pajic](https://people.duke.edu/~mp275/) in the topic of autonomous vehicles security. In 2021, I received the Dean's Research Award for Master's students. 

Prior to this, I received the B.S. in Statistical Science and B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020 and graduated with high distinction. I worked in DASH group supervised by Dr. Benjamin Wiggins in several projects related to digital arts and humanities, and one of the representatives is [Search University Press Books](https://www.lib.umn.edu/collections/search-up-books). In 2020, I received the Buehler Memorial Undergraduate Award from the School of Statistics. 

My research interest lies in the field of Security & Privacy and Trustworthy AI.
